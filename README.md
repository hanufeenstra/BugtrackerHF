BugtrackerHF - A simple issue-tracking application

####################################################

This project is still a Work in Progress and the
repository will be updated regularly.

####################################################

Description:

This is a simple issue-tracking application, users can create an account, log new issues, view issues assigned to them, edit, escalate and resolve issues.

More features will be added as development progresses.

Motivation:

This project mainly serves as a learning environment where I can implement design patterns and best practices in a real-world environment.

Technologies already implemented:

ASP.NET Core MVC,
EF Core,
Auth0 3rd party authentication,
Bootstrap Template (Corona Dark Admin Template)

####################################################

I am also hosting a version of this application at dev.hanufeenstra.co.za

As this is still a work in progress you can expect errors.

The hosted version will also be updated regularly, although not as often as the repository.
